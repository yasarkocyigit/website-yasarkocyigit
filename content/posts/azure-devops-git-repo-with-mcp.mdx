Modern data teams bounce between repos, notebooks, and orchestration tooling. I wrote about connecting Azure DevOps Git to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so engineers can pull notebooks, configs, and infrastructure code straight into their workspace without manual sync.

## Why the integration matters

- Keeps Terraform, SQL notebooks, and pipeline definitions in a single governed repo.
- Eliminates ad-hoc PAT usage by anchoring scopes and secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- Lets platform teams version control MCP prompts while enabling self-serve analytics squads.

## Read the walkthrough

The full guide lives on my Medium blog. It covers:

1. Creating the Azure DevOps service connection and tightening PAT scope.
2. Registering MCP with the correct permissions and environment variables.
3. Testing the handshake from a local CLI before promoting to shared environments.
