## Building a Production Ready Data Pipeline with Azure Part 4: From Mount Points to Unity Catalog Direct Storage

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*2LM8avOmN85TMCh_Jw2y4w.jpeg) Welcome to Part 4 of my comprehensive series on building production-ready data pipelines with Azure! In this installment, I’ll tackle one of the most critical migrations in modern data engineering: transitioning from traditional mount points to Unity Catalog’s External Locations.

## Series Overview

This article is part of my ongoing series:

- Part 1: [Building a Production-Ready Data Pipeline with Azure: Complete Guide to Medallion Architecture](/blog/azure-part-1-medallion-architecture) - Where I established the foundation with the medallion architecture
- Part 2: [Unity Catalog Integration](/blog/azure-part-1-medallion-architecture) - Introducing Unity Catalog to the pipeline
- Part 3: [Advanced Unity Catalog Table Management](/blog/azure-part-1-medallion-architecture) - Deep dive into managed vs external tables
- Part 4: From Mount Points to Unity Catalog Direct Storage (this article)

## Introduction

In Parts 1–3, I built a robust data pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Unity Catalog. However, my implementation still relied on mount points for storage access - a legacy approach that doesn’t fully leverage Unity Catalog’s capabilities.

In this article, I’ll complete the modernization journey by migrating from mount points to Unity Catalog’s External Locations, achieving true cloud-native data governance.

For official documentation, refer to:

- [Unity Catalog Cloud Storage Guide](https://docs.databricks.com/en/connect/unity-catalog/cloud-storage.html)

## Why This Migration Matters

If you’ve been following my series, you’ve seen how I progressively enhanced the data pipeline:

- In Part 1, I established a solid medallion architecture with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers
- In Part 2, I integrated Unity Catalog for governance
- In Part 3, I optimized table management with external and managed tables

However, I was still using mount points - a practice that limits Unity Catalog’s security and governance benefits. This final migration removes that limitation, giving me:

- True fine-grained access control
- Centralized credential management
- Better audit trails
- Simplified multi-workspace collaboration

## The Problem with Mount Points

For years, mount points have been the go-to method for accessing Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) in Databricks. While functional, this approach has several limitations:

## Security Concerns

- Cluster-level authentication: Credentials are configured at the cluster level, giving all users the same access rights
- No fine-grained access control: Difficult to implement row-level or column-level security
- Credential management: Service principal credentials need to be managed and rotated manually

## Operational Challenges

- Manual setup: Each cluster requires mount point configuration
- Lack of audit trails: Limited visibility into who accessed what data and when
- No centralized governance: Each workspace manages its own mounts independently

## Scalability Issues

- Cross-workspace sharing: Difficult to share data securely across multiple workspaces
- Maintenance overhead: As the number of clusters grows, mount management becomes cumbersome

## Enter Unity Catalog

Unity Catalog addresses these limitations by providing:

1. Centralized Governance: Single source of truth for all data assets
2. Fine-grained Access Control: Permissions at catalog, schema, table, and even row/column level
3. Built-in Audit Logging: Complete audit trail of all data access
4. Credential-free Access: Managed identities and storage credentials handled automatically
5. Cross-workspace Collaboration: Seamless data sharing across workspaces

## Architecture Overview

## Traditional Mount Point Architecture

```bash
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│  Databricks     │     │   ADLS Gen2      │
│  Cluster        │────▶│                  │
│  (Mount Points) │     │  /mnt/bronze     │
└─────────────────┘     │  /mnt/silver     │
                        │  /mnt/gold       │
                        └──────────────────┘
```

## Unity Catalog Architecture

```sql
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│  Databricks     │────▶│  Unity Catalog   │────▶│   ADLS Gen2      │
│  Cluster        │     │                  │     │                  │
│  (UC Enabled)   │     │ Storage Creds    │     │  External Locs   │
└─────────────────┘     │ External Locs    │     └──────────────────┘
                        │ Permissions      │
                        └──────────────────┘
```

## Migration Strategy

Building on the foundation I established in previous parts, my migration follows a systematic approach that preserves the existing medallion architecture while modernizing the storage access layer.

## Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

1. Inventory Current Mount Points

- Document all existing mount points
- Map mount paths to their ADLS locations
- Identify access patterns and dependencies
- List all notebooks and jobs using mount points

2. Design Unity Catalog Structure

- Define catalog hierarchy
- Plan external location structure
- Design permission model
- Map mount points to Unity Catalog paths

3. Check Prerequisites

- Ensure Unity Catalog is enabled in your workspace
- Verify Azure permissions for creating storage credentials
- Confirm cluster compatibility with Unity Catalog

## Phase 2: Unity Catalog Setup

- Step 1: Create Storage Credentials

Storage credentials securely store authentication information for accessing cloud storage.

```sql
-- Create storage credential using Azure Managed Identity (Recommended) CREATE STORAGE CREDENTIAL IF NOT EXISTS adls_storage_credential
WITH (
  AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY
);
```

```
-- Alternative: Using Service Principal
CREATE STORAGE CREDENTIAL IF NOT EXISTS adls_storage_credential
WITH (
  AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL (
    TENANT_ID = '<tenant-id>',
    CLIENT_ID = '<client-id>',
    CLIENT_SECRET = '<client-secret>'
  )
);
```

- Step 2: Create External Locations

```sql
-- Create external locations for each data layer
CREATE EXTERNAL LOCATION IF NOT EXISTS bronze_location
URL 'abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/bronze'
WITH (CREDENTIAL adls_storage_credential);
```

```
CREATE EXTERNAL LOCATION IF NOT EXISTS silver_location
URL 'abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/silver'
WITH (CREDENTIAL adls_storage_credential);
```

```
CREATE EXTERNAL LOCATION IF NOT EXISTS gold_location
URL 'abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/gold'
WITH (CREDENTIAL adls_storage_credential);
```

- Step 3: Grant Permissions

```sql
-- Grant appropriate permissions
GRANT READ FILES ON EXTERNAL LOCATION bronze_location TO `data_engineers`;
GRANT WRITE FILES ON EXTERNAL LOCATION silver_location TO `data_engineers`;
```

## Phase 3: Pipeline Migration

This phase builds directly on the work I did in Parts 1–3. My existing control tables and pipeline structure made the migration straightforward.

- 1. Update Control Tables

I maintained a control table that stored paths for my data pipeline:

```javascript
-- Before: Mount-based paths
-- /mnt/bronze/dataset/table
-- /mnt/silver/dataset/table
```

```
-- After: Direct ABFSS paths
-- abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/bronze/dataset/table
-- abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/silver/dataset/table
```

```
UPDATE control.tables
SET 
    bronze_path = REPLACE(bronze_path, '/mnt/', 'abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/'),
    silver_path = REPLACE(silver_path, '/mnt/', 'abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/') WHERE bronze_path LIKE '/mnt/%';
```

- 2. Update Notebook Code

Building on the Unity Catalog integration from Part 2:

Original mount-based code:

```bash
# Old approach from Part 1
df = spark.read.parquet("/mnt/bronze/sales/orders") df.write.mode("overwrite").parquet("/mnt/silver/sales/orders")
```

Updated Unity Catalog approach:

```ini
# New approach - Unity Catalog handles authentication
bronze_path = "abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/bronze/sales/orders"
silver_path = "abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/silver/sales/orders"
```

```
df = spark.read.parquet(bronze_path) df.write.mode("overwrite").parquet(silver_path)
```

```
# Register as Unity Catalog table (as we learned in Part 3) df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("main.silver.sales_orders")
```

- 3. Create Unity Catalog Tables

```python
# Create external table pointing to existing data
spark.sql("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS main.silver.sales_orders
    USING DELTA
    LOCATION 'abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/silver/sales/orders'
""")
```

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation

I implemented comprehensive testing to ensure data integrity:

```python
def validate_migration(mount_path, unity_path):
    """Validate data consistency between mount and Unity Catalog paths"""
    
    # Read from both sources
    mount_df = spark.read.parquet(mount_path) unity_df = spark.read.parquet(unity_path)
    
    # Compare counts
    mount_count = mount_df.count() unity_count = unity_df.count() assert mount_count == unity_count, f"Count mismatch: {mount_count} vs {unity_count}"
    
    # Compare schemas
    assert mount_df.schema == unity_df.schema, "Schema mismatch"
    
    # Sample data comparison
    mount_sample = mount_df.limit(1000).toPandas() unity_sample = unity_df.limit(1000).toPandas() assert mount_sample.equals(unity_sample), "Data mismatch"
    
    return True
```

## Phase 5: Cutover and Cleanup

After successful validation, I performed the final cutover. Important: Only remove mount points after confirming all pipelines are working with Unity Catalog.

- Step 1: Final Validation

```python
# Ensure all pipelines have been migrated
def validate_no_mount_usage():
    """Check if any active code still uses mount points"""
    notebooks_to_check = [
        "/path/to/notebook1",
        "/path/to/notebook2"
    ]
    
    mount_usage = []
    for notebook in notebooks_to_check:
        content = dbutils.notebook.run(notebook, 0, {"dry_run": "true"}) if "/mnt/" in content:
            mount_usage.append(notebook) if mount_usage:
        print(f"Warning: {len(mount_usage)} notebooks still reference mount points") return False
    return True
```

- Step 2: Remove Mount Points

```python
# Remove mount points only after all validations pass
def cleanup_mounts():
    """Remove legacy mount points"""
    mounts_to_remove = ['/mnt/bronze', '/mnt/silver', '/mnt/gold']
    
    # First, list current mounts
    current_mounts = dbutils.fs.mounts() print(f"Current mounts: {len(current_mounts)}") for mount in mounts_to_remove:
        try:
            # Check if mount exists
            if any(m.mountPoint == mount for m in current_mounts):
                dbutils.fs.unmount(mount) print(f"Successfully unmounted: {mount}") else:
                print(f"Mount not found: {mount}") except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error unmounting {mount}: {str(e)}")
    
    # Verify removal
    remaining_mounts = [m.mountPoint for m in dbutils.fs.mounts() if '/mnt/' in m.mountPoint]
    if remaining_mounts:
        print(f"Warning: Some mounts still exist: {remaining_mounts}") else:
        print("All mount points successfully removed")
```

```
# Execute only after confirmation
if validate_no_mount_usage():
    cleanup_mounts() else:
    print("Cannot remove mounts - some notebooks still use them")
```

## Key Learnings and Best Practices

## 1. Handle Case Sensitivity

One critical issue I encountered was case sensitivity in paths. ADLS is case-sensitive, so ensure your paths match exactly:

- ❌ `/Bronze/Sales/Orders`
- ✅ `/bronze/sales/orders`

## 2. Use Unity Catalog Native Commands

Replace `dbutils.fs.ls()` with Unity Catalog SQL commands:

```ini
# Old way
files = dbutils.fs.ls("/mnt/bronze/sales")
```

```
# New way
files = spark.sql("LIST 'abfss://container@storage.dfs.core.windows.net/bronze/sales'")
```

## 3. Implement Proper Error Handling

Unity Catalog provides better error messages, but proper handling is still crucial:

```python
try:
    df = spark.read.parquet(unity_path) except Exception as e:
    if "PERMISSION_DENIED" in str(e):
        print("Check Unity Catalog permissions") elif "PATH_NOT_FOUND" in str(e):
        print("Verify the external location exists") else:
        raise e
```

## 4. Leverage Managed Tables Where Appropriate

As I explored in Part 3, the choice between external and managed tables is crucial:

```python
# External table - you control the location (from Part 3) spark.sql("""
    CREATE TABLE catalog.schema.external_table
    USING DELTA
    LOCATION 'abfss://path/to/data'
""")
```

```
# Managed table - Unity Catalog manages storage (from Part 3) df.write.saveAsTable("catalog.schema.managed_table")
```

## 5. Monitor Performance

I observed performance improvements after migration:

- Faster metadata operations: Unity Catalog caches metadata
- Improved query planning: Better statistics and optimization
- Reduced authentication overhead: No mount point initialization

## Benefits Realized

## 1. Enhanced Security

- Fine-grained access control: Different teams have appropriate access levels
- Audit compliance: Complete audit trail for regulatory requirements
- Simplified credential management: Azure Managed Identity eliminates credential rotation

## 2. Operational Excellence

- Centralized governance: Single place to manage all data assets
- Better monitoring: Built-in metrics and logging
- Simplified troubleshooting: Clear error messages and permission denials

## 3. Improved Collaboration

- Cross-workspace sharing: Data easily shared across different environments
- Consistent data discovery: Users can find and understand available datasets
- Version control: Delta Lake integration provides time travel capabilities

## 4. Cost Optimization

- Reduced cluster startup time: No mount point initialization overhead
- Better resource utilization: Improved query optimization
- Simplified infrastructure: Fewer components to manage

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

## 1. Incomplete Permission Setup

Problem: Users get permission denied errors Solution: Verify permissions at all levels:

```sql
-- Check external location permissions
SHOW GRANTS ON EXTERNAL LOCATION bronze_location;
```

```
-- Check catalog permissions
SHOW GRANTS ON CATALOG main;
```

```
-- Check schema permissions
SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA main.bronze;
```

## 2. Path Format Issues

Problem: Invalid path formats cause failures Solution: Always use the correct ABFSS format:

```cpp
abfss://[container]@[storage_account].dfs.core.windows.net/[path]
```

## 3. Cluster Configuration

Problem: Cluster not Unity Catalog enabled Solution: Ensure cluster has Unity Catalog enabled in advanced options

## 4. Mixed Authentication

Problem: Conflicts between mount points and Unity Catalog Solution: Complete migration before removing mounts, avoid mixed usage
