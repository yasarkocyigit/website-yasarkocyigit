Databricks offers two main personas for interactive analytics: classic SQL warehouses and the newer Serverless flavor. Picking one without a decision framework leads to sticker shock or frustrated analysts. I map decisions to three axes: latency expectations, concurrency, and governance overhead.

## Start with the workload envelope

When teams need predictable sub-second dash refreshes during trading hours, Serverless wins because capacity is managed by Databricks and cold starts are minimal. For nightly finance refreshes or batch-heavy workloads, classic SQL warehouses allow finer control over cluster size, auto-stop rules, and spot usage. I model expected query load by daypart to understand where the base utilization sits.

## Evaluate concurrency against budget

Serverless abstracts cluster management but charges per request. High concurrency teams that run many short queries can overspend quickly unless caching is tuned and dashboards consolidated. In those cases I prefer larger, classic warehouses with predictable DBU burn rates. When concurrency is bursty and driven by ad-hoc notebooks, Serverless shines because it auto-scales without needing on-call intervention.

## Factor in governance integrations

Unity Catalog, row-level security, and audit logging behave similarly across both options, but partner ecosystems can differ. If BI tooling needs JDBC/ODBC connectivity with pushdown filters, the managed endpoints of Serverless remove a lot of configuration. When teams embed SQL in orchestration systems or want granular Terraform control, classic warehouses give more knobs.

## Model the blended cost

Instead of comparing list prices, I build blended charts showing base load, auto-scaling, and idle time. For some clients the answer is both: Serverless for experimentation sandboxes and critical dashboards, classic warehouses for predictable reporting. The decision gets revisited quarterly as usage data rolls in.
