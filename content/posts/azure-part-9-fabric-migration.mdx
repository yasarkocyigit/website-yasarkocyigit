Today, we’re addressing a critical evolution: migrating from Synapse Serverless SQL Pool to Microsoft Fabric’s unified analytics platform.

## Why Migrate to Microsoft Fabric?

## The Limitations We’re Facing

After running our Synapse Serverless SQL Pool solution in production, we’ve encountered several challenges:

1. Concurrency Bottlenecks: Serverless SQL Pool handles only 15 concurrent requests, with additional requests queued
2. Performance Variability: Cold start times ranging from 2–10 seconds impact user experience
3. Limited Caching: No automatic result caching leads to repeated full scans
4. Complex Authentication: Multiple connection strings and authentication methods
5. Fragmented Experience: Separate services for compute, storage, and analytics

## The Fabric Advantage

Microsoft Fabric addresses these limitations with:

- Unified Platform: Single workspace for all analytics needs
- OneLake Integration: Built-in data lake with automatic optimization
- SQL Analytics Endpoint: Serverless compute with enhanced performance
- Seamless Power BI Integration: Native connectivity without additional configuration
- Improved Concurrency: Better handling of concurrent requests
- Automatic Caching: Intelligent query result caching

## Understanding the Technology Mapping

Let’s map our current Synapse components to their Fabric equivalents:

## The Migration Strategy: 4-Phase Approach

## Phase 1: Assessment and Discovery

First, let’s catalog our existing Serverless SQL Pool assets to understand what needs to be migrated.

## Phase 2: Fabric Workspace Setup with OneLake Shortcuts

The core of our migration involves creating OneLake shortcuts that point to our existing Delta tables in ADLS Gen2. This approach provides zero-copy access to our data without any data movement.

- Step 1: Create ADLS Gen2 Connection in Fabric

Before creating shortcuts, we need to establish a connection to our ADLS Gen2 storage account:

1. Navigate to Power BI Service (app.powerbi.com)
2. Go to Settings (gear icon) → Manage connections and gateways
3. Click on “New” to create a new connection
4. Select “Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2” as the connection type
5. Configure the connection:

- Connection Name: `ADLS-Gold-Layer-Connection`
- Storage Account URL: `[https://yourstorage.dfs.core.windows.net`](https://yourstorage.dfs.core.windows.net)
- Authentication Method: Service Principal or Managed Identity
- Tenant ID: Your Azure AD tenant ID
- Service Principal ID: Your service principal application ID
- Service Principal Key: Your service principal secret

6. Test the connection to ensure it works

7. Save the connection and copy the Connection ID (you’ll need this for the shortcuts)

- Step 2: Create Lakehouse and Configure Shortcuts

Now we can proceed with creating the OneLake shortcuts using the connection ID from Step 1:

```python
# Fabric notebook for automated shortcut creation
# This runs inside a Fabric notebook with authentication already configured

print("="*60) print("FABRIC MIGRATION: AUTOMATED SHORTCUT CREATION") print("="*60) import pandas as pd
import sempy.fabric as fabric
from notebookutils import mssparkutils
import requests
import time
from datetime import datetime
# Fabric authentication
url = 'https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/'
access_token = mssparkutils.credentials.getToken(url)
# Configuration - Replace with your values
workspaceId = 'your-workspace-id'
lakehouseid = 'your-lakehouse-id'  
targetconnectionid = 'your-connection-id'  
targetlocation = 'https://yourstorage.dfs.core.windows.net'
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
print("Creating API shortcuts under dbo schema with drop-if-exists logic...") api_url = f"https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/items/{lakehouseid}/shortcuts"
# Define your star schema tables
tables_to_create = [
    ("dim_customer", "gold/star_schema/dim_customer"),
    ("dim_date", "gold/star_schema/dim_date"),
    ("dim_product", "gold/star_schema/dim_product"),
    ("dim_territory", "gold/star_schema/dim_territory"),
    ("dim_salesperson", "gold/star_schema/dim_salesperson"),
    ("dim_store", "gold/star_schema/dim_store"),
    ("dim_promotion", "gold/star_schema/dim_promotion"),
    ("fact_sales", "gold/star_schema/fact_sales"),
    ("fact_sales_summary", "gold/star_schema/fact_sales_summary")
]
successful_shortcuts = []
failed_shortcuts = []
for shortcutname, goldpath in tables_to_create:
    print(f"\nProcessing: dbo.{shortcutname}")
    
    # Step 1: Check if shortcut exists
    check_url = f"https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/items/{lakehouseid}/shortcuts/Tables/dbo/{shortcutname}"
    check_response = requests.get(check_url, headers=headers)
    
    # Step 2: If exists, delete it first
    if check_response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"   Shortcut exists, deleting first...") delete_response = requests.delete(check_url, headers=headers) if delete_response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"   Successfully deleted existing shortcut") time.sleep(2)  # Wait for deletion to complete
        else:
            print(f"   Failed to delete: {delete_response.status_code} - {delete_response.text}")
    
    # Step 3: Create new shortcut
    payload = {
        "path": "Tables/dbo",  # Create under dbo schema
        "name": shortcutname,
        "target": {
            "AdlsGen2": {
                "location": targetlocation,
                "subpath": f"datalake/{goldpath}",
                "connectionId": targetconnectionid
            }
        }
    }
    
    response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload) if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"   SUCCESS: dbo.{shortcutname} created") successful_shortcuts.append(shortcutname) elif response.status_code == 409:
        print(f"   ALREADY EXISTS: dbo.{shortcutname}") successful_shortcuts.append(shortcutname) else:
        print(f"   FAILED: dbo.{shortcutname} - {response.status_code}") print(f"   Error: {response.text}") failed_shortcuts.append(shortcutname) time.sleep(2)
# Summary
print(f"\n" + "="*60) print("SHORTCUT CREATION SUMMARY") print("="*60) print(f"Successful: {len(successful_shortcuts)}") print(f"Failed: {len(failed_shortcuts)}") if failed_shortcuts:
    print(f"\nFailed shortcuts:") for shortcut in failed_shortcuts:
        print(f"  - {shortcut}") print("\nWaiting for shortcuts to sync...") time.sleep(15)
# Test the shortcuts
print("\nTesting dbo schema shortcuts...") for shortcutname, _ in tables_to_create:
    try:
        # Test access via dbo schema path
        df = spark.read.format("delta").load(f"Tables/dbo/{shortcutname}") count = df.count() print(f"   dbo.{shortcutname}: {count:,} rows - SUCCESS")
        
        # Create temp view for SQL access
        df.createOrReplaceTempView(shortcutname) except Exception as e:
        print(f"   dbo.{shortcutname}: Failed - {str(e)}") print("\nTesting SQL queries...") try:
    result = spark.sql("SELECT COUNT(*) as cnt FROM dim_customer").collect()[0].cnt
    print(f"SQL test: dim_customer has {result:,} rows") except Exception as e:
    print(f"SQL test failed: {str(e)}")
```

## Phase 3: Power BI Report Migration

After creating the shortcuts, we need to update our Power BI reports to use the new Fabric SQL Analytics Endpoint:

1. Open Power BI Desktop
2. Navigate to Transform Data > Data Source Settings
3. Update Connection Details:

- From: `your-synapse.sql.azuresynapse.net`
- To: SQL Analytics Endpoint of your Fabric Lakehouse

4. Update Schema References:

- From: `star_schema.table_name`
- To: `dbo.table_name`

Since we’re using parameterized connections, this can be done by simply updating the parameter values:

```plaintext
// Update these parameters in Power Query
ServerName = "your-fabric-sql-endpoint.datawarehouse.fabric.microsoft.com"
DatabaseName = "your_lakehouse_name"
SchemaName = "dbo"
```

## Phase 4: Validation and Cutover

Before fully migrating, validate the new setup:

```python
# Validation script to compare data between Synapse and Fabric
def validate_migration():
    """
    Compare row counts and sample data between 
    Synapse Serverless SQL Pool and Fabric
    """
    
    validation_results = []
    
    for table_name, _ in tables_to_create:
        try:
            # Get row count from Fabric
            fabric_count = spark.sql(f"SELECT COUNT(*) as cnt FROM {table_name}").collect()[0].cnt
            
            # Get sample data for validation
            sample_df = spark.sql(f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} LIMIT 5") validation_results.append({
                'table': table_name,
                'row_count': fabric_count,
                'status': 'SUCCESS',
                'sample_rows': sample_df.count()
            }) except Exception as e:
            validation_results.append({
                'table': table_name,
                'row_count': 0,
                'status': 'FAILED',
                'error': str(e)
            })
    
    # Create validation report
    validation_df = pd.DataFrame(validation_results) print("\nVALIDATION REPORT") print("="*60) print(validation_df.to_string()) return validation_df
```

```
# Run validation
validation_report = validate_migration()
```

## Performance Comparison: Before and After

Let’s look at the real-world performance improvements we achieved:

## Query Performance Metrics

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*8p1wer8ts7XBb0Qidczjlg.png)

## Cost Analysis

```
Synapse Serverless SQL Pool:
- Data Processed: 10 TB/month
- Cost: $5/TB = $50
- Additional: Synapse workspace overhead
```

```
Microsoft Fabric:
- Capacity: F2 SKU
- Cost: ~$0.18/hour = ~$130/month
- Includes: Compute, Storage, Power BI
```

```
Result: Similar cost but with significantly better performance and features
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

## Pitfall 1: Schema Mismatch

Problem: Tables created under wrong schema in Fabric Solution: Always specify `"path": "Tables/dbo"` in shortcut creation

## Pitfall 2: Authentication Failures

Problem: Connection ID not working Solution: Ensure the connection is created in the same workspace

## Pitfall 3: Performance Degradation

Problem: Queries slower than expected Solution: Enable V-Order optimization on Delta tables

## Pitfall 4: Missing Data

Problem: Some tables not showing data Solution: Check Delta table version compatibility

## Best Practices for Production Migration

1. Start with Non-Critical Reports: Migrate development/test reports first
2. Use Parallel Run Period: Keep both systems running for 2–4 weeks
3. Implement Monitoring: Set up alerts for failed queries or performance issues
4. Document Everything: Keep detailed migration logs
5. Have Rollback Plan: Maintain ability to switch back if needed

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

## V-Order Optimization

Optimize your Delta tables for better query performance:

```python
# Apply V-Order optimization to Delta tables
from delta.tables import DeltaTable
for table_name, delta_path in tables_to_create:
    table_path = f"abfss://datalake@yourstorage.dfs.core.windows.net/{delta_path}"
    
    # Optimize with Z-Order
    delta_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, table_path) delta_table.optimize().executeZOrderBy("date_key", "customer_key") print(f"Optimized: {table_name}")
```

## Conclusion

Migrating from Synapse Serverless SQL Pool to Microsoft Fabric represents a significant step forward in our data platform evolution. The benefits are clear:

- Simplicity: Unified platform reduces complexity
- Cost: Similar or lower TCO with better features
- Future-Ready: Built on Microsoft’s latest analytics platform

The migration process, while requiring careful planning, can be largely automated using the scripts provided. The key is to approach it systematically, validate thoroughly, and maintain a rollback option during the transition period.
