Data teams love to debate how revenue is calculated; boards just need a number they can trust. Unity Catalog metric views give us the control plane to make that trust persistent, audited, and portable across tools. The pattern below is the playbook I repeat with every finance and product analytics team.

## Standardize semantics before SQL is written

The first stand-up artifact is a glossary table. Every metric candidate lands in a control table with columns for definition, owner, usage notes, and expiry. It is versioned through Unity Catalog so the semantics change only through pull requests. That catalogue entry becomes the contract that downstream queries must map to, not the other way around.

### Break product lines into shareable dimensions

Metric views rarely live alone. I model dimensions (like region, product family, sales segment) as reusable Delta tables that metric views can reference. By storing all of them in the same Unity Catalog schema, governance policies for PII or restricted geos apply consistently whether a dashboard lives in Databricks SQL, Power BI, or a CSV export.

## Publish metric views with naming discipline

I enforce a `metric_{domain}_{name}` convention and register every view in a dedicated catalog. The additional verbosity pays off when someone types `SHOW METRIC FUNCTIONS IN catalog`. They immediately see who the owner is, what filters are applied, and where the tests live. Access policies are bound to the catalog so promotion from staging to production is a metadata change, not a redeploy.

## Automate quality signals

Metric views are only trusted if drift is surfaced quickly. I schedule lightweight notebooks that evaluate deltas across time, highlight volume anomalies, and attach the results back to the Unity Catalog comment field. Product managers skimming a BI tool can click into the metric view and see whether it is greenlit or under investigation.

## Equip consumers with distribution-ready endpoints

Finally I map each metric view into the serving layer the business actually uses. That might be a Databricks SQL endpoint for interactive workbooks, Delta Live Tables for automated exports, or Databricks Connect for embedded notebooks. Because Unity Catalog keeps lineage, we know exactly which dashboards refresh off the canonical definition the moment a change is proposed.
