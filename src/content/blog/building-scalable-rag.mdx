# Building Scalable RAG Systems

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is becoming the standard for grounding LLMs in proprietary data. However, scaling these systems presents unique challenges.

## The Challenge

When moving from a prototype with 100 documents to a production system with 10 million, latency and retrieval quality often degrade.

### Key Optimization Strategies

1. **Hybrid Search**: Combining dense vector search with sparse keyword search (BM25) often yields better results than either alone.
2. **Re-ranking**: Using a cross-encoder to re-rank the top K results can significantly improve precision.
3. **Metadata Filtering**: Efficiently filtering chunks based on metadata before vector search.

```python
def hybrid_search(query, k=10):
    dense_results = vector_db.search(query, k=k)
    sparse_results = keyword_db.search(query, k=k)
    return merge_and_rank(dense_results, sparse_results)
```

## Conclusion

Scaling RAG requires a multi-layered approach to retrieval.
