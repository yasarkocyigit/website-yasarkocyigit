# The Evolution of Data Pipelines

Data engineering has shifted rapidly. The traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) model is being replaced by ELT (Extract, Load, Transform).

## Why the Shift?

Compute power in modern data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery) has become cheap and elastic. It makes sense to load raw data first and transform it in place using SQL.

### Benefits of ELT

- **Agility**: Analysts can create transformations without waiting for engineers to update the pipeline.
- **Visibility**: Lineage tools like dbt make transformations transparent.

## Looking Ahead

Streaming pipelines are the next frontier, blurring the line between batch and real-time.
