# Large Scale Knowledge Graph

**Role**: AI Engineer  
**Stack**: Python, Spacy, Neo4j, Transformers  

## Context
A legal tech firm wanted to uncover hidden relationships between entities in millions of court documents.

## Implementation

### 1. Entity Extraction (NER)
We fine-tuned a RoBERTa model on legal texts to extract Persons, Organizations, and Laws.

### 2. Relation Extraction
Used a dependency-parsing approach combined with a classification model to determine relationship types (e.g., "SUED_BY", "OWNED_BY").

### 3. Graph Modeling
Modeled in Neo4j. Used standard property graph conventions.

## Lessons Learned
- **Entity Resolution** is harder than extraction. We implemented a custom clustering algorithm to merge "Apple Inc." and "Apple".
- **Visualisation** at scale requires WebGL. Node-link diagrams clutter easily.
